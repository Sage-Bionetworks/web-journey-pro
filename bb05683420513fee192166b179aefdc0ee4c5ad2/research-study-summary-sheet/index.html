                            <p>We would like to invite you to join the Journey PRO research study. You must be age 18 or older and have an iPhone model 5 or newer​ with iOS 8 or later​ to join. We encourage people with chronic anemia as a result of beta thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or myelofibrosis and people who do not have chronic anemia to join Journey PRO.</p>
                            <p>If you want to join the study, you will need to download the Journey PRO app. Once you download the app, you will be asked to complete a consent process. This process will tell you more about the study. It will tell you the risks and benefits of taking part. It will tell you more about what we will ask you to do. It lists who to call or email if you have questions, concerns, or complaints about the research or about your rights as a research participant. At the end, will ask you to electronically sign a consent form. Then you can take part in Journey PRO.</p>
                            <h3>Why are we doing this study?</h3>
                            <p>Living with chronic anemia means coping with symptoms that can change daily. These symptoms can impact your quality of life. We are doing this study to better understand day-to-day quality of life. You will help us learn the range of experience for people with and without chronic anemia. Also, you will help us find out how mobile devices can help measure what life is like with chronic anemia.</p>
                            <h3>What will I be asked to do?</h3>
                            <p>In the study we will measure quality of life by looking at health and well-being. We will ask you to download the Journey PRO app. We will track things like fatigue, memory, and fitness through this app.</p>
                            <p>We will also give some participants an Apple Watch to use as a fitness tracker. It will measure activity and heart rate, which are signs of health and well-being. We will look for patterns in the data. In this way, we hope to learn more about how chronic anemia impacts quality of life for people.</p>
                            <h3>How much time will it take?</h3>
                            <p>To get started, we will ask you to do an informed consent process. It takes about 20 minutes. We will also ask you to do a one-time health survey. It takes about 20 minutes.</p>
                            <p>After that, we will ask you to complete a daily survey. You can choose the time of day you complete it. The survey takes about 5 minutes to complete.</p>
                            <p>Once a week, we will ask you to do a 40 minute challenge. The challenge has a survey</p>

                            <p>We hope that people will participate for at least 12 weeks in a row.</p>
                            <h3>Is this a clinical trial? Is it medical care?</h3>
                            <p>Journey PRO is an observational study. It is not a clinical trial. We will not be asking you to change what you do or take medication as part of this study. It is not medical treatment. If you have questions about your health, please see your regular doctor.</p>
                            <h3>What are the risks of participating?</h3>
                            <p>The main risk of taking part in the Journey PRO research study is to your privacy. If there is a data breach, someone could get access to the information we have about you. Your information could be misused. We believe the chance of this is very small, but it is not zero.</p>
                            <p>We will gather information from you through the Journey PRO app and may also through an Apple Watch. There is a risk to your privacy whenever you use an app or fitness tracker like an Apple Watch. In general, there is no additional risk to your privacy if you use these technologies as part of the Journey PRO research study​. ​However, we will be collecting several different types of information from you, so if there is a data breach, there may be additional risk to your privacy because of the amount of information the study database contains about you.</p>
                            <h3>What will you do to protect my privacy?</h3>
                            <p>Your privacy is very important to us. We will take great care to protect it.</p>

                                <li>We will separate your study data from the account information that identifies you. Your account information will not be stored with your study data.</li>
                                <li>Your study data will not be labeled with your name or other information that directly identifies you. We will label it with a random code. There will be a master list linking the codes to names, but we will keep it separate and secure.</li>
                                <li>All information we have about you will be stored on protected computers. We will limit and keep track of who sees the information.</li>

                            <p>Journey PRO is not a medical treatment. It is a research study. You will not get direct medical benefit from taking part in it. You will be helping scientists make discoveries that may help others in the future with similar diseases.</p>
                            <p>You may indirectly benefit from taking part. For example, you will be able to see all of your study data. This information may be interesting to you. You may learn about your health and well-being. If you choose, you can share your Journey PRO information with your health care team.</p>
                            <p>We may give you an Apple Watch to use in the study. You can keep it after the study ends and use it for as long as you like.</p>
